Plotting steps from Rachel:

1. I made a "Python - AI" kernel following the gist from Francois: https://gist.github.com/EiffL/a8cfa39c635334d063f0d3c07a85d1ec (just the "module load AI" part, no custom packages, in Step I; then Step2 II and III as in the gist)

2. Then I modified a version of the notebook from DeeplyUncertain-Public to read in and process Scott's data, and make plots.  That notebook version is in this directory.  It needs the "Python - AI" kernel to run the later bits (which use tensorflow).

3. It needs data_gen from the other repo, so you can copy this back to where those files live.
